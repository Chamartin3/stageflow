"""Property-based testing for StageFlow components.

This module contains property-based tests using the Hypothesis library to validate
invariants and explore edge cases in the StageFlow framework's core components.

The property tests complement the existing unit test suite by automatically
generating test cases that explore a much wider range of inputs and scenarios
than traditional example-based testing.
