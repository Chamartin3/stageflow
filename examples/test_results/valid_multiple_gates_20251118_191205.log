❌ Process: content_moderation (Invalid)
   Initial Stage: submitted
   Final Stage: published
   Total Stages: 7

Stages:
├─ submitted → published, under_review, rejected
├─ published (final)
├─ under_review → published, rejected, revision_requested, senior_review
├─ rejected
├─ revision_requested → under_review, abandoned
├─ abandoned
└─ senior_review → published, rejected

❌ Consistency Issues:
   • Stage 'rejected' cannot reach final stage 'published'
   • Stage 'abandoned' cannot reach final stage 'published'
   • Circular dependency detected: stages can transition in a cycle without 
reaching the final stage

⚠️  This process is not valid for execution due to the above consistency issues.
