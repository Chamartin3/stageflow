❌ Process: unreachable_stages (Invalid)
   Initial Stage: start
   Final Stage: reachable_end
   Total Stages: 7

Stages:
├─ start → middle
├─ middle → reachable_end
├─ reachable_end (final)
├─ isolated_stage_1 → isolated_stage_2
├─ isolated_stage_2 → isolated_stage_1
├─ orphaned_stage
└─ dead_end

❌ Consistency Issues:
   • Stage 'isolated_stage_1' cannot reach final stage 'reachable_end'
   • Stage 'isolated_stage_2' cannot reach final stage 'reachable_end'
   • Stage 'orphaned_stage' cannot reach final stage 'reachable_end'
   • Stage 'dead_end' cannot reach final stage 'reachable_end'
   • Stage 'orphaned_stage' has no gates, is not marked as final, and is not 
referenced by any other stage
   • Stage 'dead_end' has no gates, is not marked as final, and is not 
referenced by any other stage
   • Circular dependency detected: stages can transition in a cycle without 
reaching the final stage

⚠️  This process is not valid for execution due to the above consistency issues.
