❌ Process: conflicting_gates (Invalid)
   Initial Stage: start
   Final Stage: end
   Total Stages: 5

Stages:
├─ start → middle_a, middle_b, impossible_stage
├─ middle_a → end
├─ end (final)
├─ middle_b → end
└─ impossible_stage → end

❌ Consistency Issues:
   • Gate 'impossible_path' in stage 'start' has conflicting conditions for 
property 'value': EQUALS 75 conflicts with GREATER_THAN 100; EQUALS 75 conflicts
with LESS_THAN 50; GREATER_THAN 100 conflicts with LESS_THAN 50
   • Gate 'finish_path_a' in stage 'middle_a' has conflicting conditions for 
property 'completion_status': multiple EQUALS conditions (pending, done)

⚠️  This process is not valid for execution due to the above consistency issues.
